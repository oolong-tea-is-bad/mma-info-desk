This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# MMA Information Desk Application

>**Note**: This is NOT an official application published by the Korean Military Manpower Administration. This is a project soley done by a social service personnel Junhyuk Lee.

## Motivation

As a social service personnel working in the MMA (Military Manpower Administration), I witnessed a few unnecessary procedures that were being taken. And wasting workforce by placing two social service personnels to explain which department to go was one of them. 

So I decided to make an application that can handle this work! 

## Objectivces

After asking other social service personnels about their jobs, I organized the features that I needed to add in my application.
1. Explaining which department handles specific tasks.

2. Saving and accessing **names**, **addresses**, and the **purposes of visit** along with the **time of visit**.


3. Supporting English for foreigners.
